# Python-ML-Pipeline-Decision_Tree_regressor
My first Kaggle machine learning challenge.

### More about the kaggle challenge 
The [House Sales in King County, USA](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction) is a simple kaggle competition. The dataset contains house sale prices for King County. It includes homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015. The goal is to predict to house prices using machine learning regressive models. 

### More about the code 
The code contains a straitghforward EDA, a simple pipline and a custom transform (class created to add to the pipeline).
